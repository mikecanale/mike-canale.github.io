                <p>I'm Mike Canale. I have brown hair and eyes. I have two legs and two arms.
                I also have two eyes and two ears. I find it interesting that animals are born with two of a 
                lot of things. Humans are animals. Therefore, humans are born with two of a lot of things. 
                I am a human. I mostly like being a human.<br>
                <br>
                I have two sons. I like them. Even though I have two of them, I wasn't born with them.
                They sort of came to me later in my life. It's merely a coincidence that I have two of them.  
                They are both humans. They are both animals. They also have two of a lot of things.<br>
                <br>
                Spiders are born with eight legs. Spiders are not human, but they are animals. Weird.<br>

                This is my website. Enjoy.<br>
